### Project Title
Explore_US_Bikeshare_Data

### Description
This project explores some U.S bikeshare data. It uses real data from a bikeshare company called Motivate for Washington, New York City and Chicago.
It analysis the data to reveal information such as which stations are most frequent by riders, the time most riders start and stop riding, the demographics, and what period of the year or day of the week.

### Files used
chicago.csv
new_york_city.csv
washington.csv

### Credits
The Udacity course covering this topic was a great resource in resolving some of the likely errors, as I had to revisit some along the line.
